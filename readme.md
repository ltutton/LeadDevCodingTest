# Lead Developer Coding Test

This project requires multiple startup to be configured for one click running. Unfortunately this doesn't get saved in the solution file. In vs2019 this is possible by:
* opening the properties for the solution file
* selecting multiple startup projects
* selecting UserList.Api and changing the action to start
* selecting UserList.UI and changing the action to start

now when you click run it will start up with a single click.
